# FASTAHeaderCleaner
Removes all space characters and square brackets from FASTA sequences

A quick script for taking an input FASTA file and replacing all " " (space) characters with hypens ("-"), and simply removing all square brackets.  Written because some tools seem to truncate FASTA headers at these characters and this can be a pain when trying to later determine where that sequence came from.
